# ArtisteSphere: The Artist-First Ecosystem

### The "Algorithm Trap" Is Broken.

The current music industry was built for *access*, not *intimacy*.

Streaming solved the distribution problem but created a "content machine." Artists are burned out, chasing playlist placements. Listeners are passive "scrollers," jumping from track to track.

We have infinite access but microscopic payouts, music everywhere but zero intimacy. We lost the value of the art.

### The Solution: From Passive Scrolling to Active Patronage.

**ArtisteSphere** is a platform built on a single word: **Trust**. It's an ecosystem designed to give artists back the control, the profit, and the direct fan connection that MySpace pioneered and the streaming era destroyed.

This is not another streaming service. It's a B2B2C platform for artists and labels to build a *real* economy around their biggest fans.

## Key Pillars

1. **The "Sphere" (Community Hub):** The artist's customizable home. A modern, secure MySpace where artists control their brand and interact with fans on their "Fan Wall."

2. **The "Stall" (Commerce Engine):** The artist's D2C marketplace. Sell merch, tickets, and our flagship digital product, the "Resonance Session," with a simple 85/15 split.

3. **The "Green Room" (Subscriptions):** The artist's private fan club. A built-in "Patreon" for artists to offer monthly subscriptions for demos, pre-sales, and private chats.

4. **The "Vault" (Digital Ownership):** The future of fandom. An *easy-to-use* (no crypto-jargon) system for fans to buy and "own" limited-edition "Patron's Keys" for "Resonance Sessions," proving their status and building a real collection.

## The "Guerilla Pilot" (Current Build)

This repository currently contains the **90-Day "Guerilla Pilot" MVP**. This is not the full, scalable app. It is a single-page case study generator built to prove one thing: **fans will pay a premium for an intimate digital experience.**

### Pilot Features:

* **`pages/index.js`:** The "Sphere" - A single landing page for one artist.

* **`pages/api/checkout.js`:** The "Stall" - A Stripe checkout flow to sell the "Resonance Session."

* **`pages/session.js`:** The "Resonance Session" - A password-protected page with the album and "Liner Notes" (videos, lyrics, etc.).

* **`pages/api/guestbook.js`:** The "Fan Wall" - A simple guestbook for paying fans to leave comments.

* **`pages/admin.js`:** The "Goldmine" - The simple admin dashboard to show investors the *real data*: total revenue, a list of fan emails, and all testimonials.
